2. **Cluster**
    - A **Cluster** is a logical unit managed by Kubernetes, consisting of one or more servers, each referred to as a **Node**.

3. **Node**
    - A **Node** in Kubernetes is a physical or virtual machine that runs as part of a Cluster. Each Node contains the necessary resources like CPU, memory, and storage to run containers, and can host Pods. Nodes can be of two types: Master Node (which is responsible for managing and controlling the Cluster) and Worker Node (which runs the actual application workloads by hosting Pods).
    - Each **Node** can run one or more containers.
